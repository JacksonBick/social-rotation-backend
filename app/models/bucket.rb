# Bucket Model
# Represents a content collection (group of images/videos)
# Can be scheduled for automatic posting to social media
# Can be sold in marketplace as a package
class Bucket < ApplicationRecord
  # ASSOCIATIONS
  # Bucket belongs to one user (owner)

  # Bucket has many bucket_images (images in this collection) - destroy when bucket deleted

  # Bucket can access images through bucket_images join table
  has_many :images, through: :bucket_images
  # Bucket has many schedules (when to post images) - destroy when bucket deleted
  has_many :bucket_schedules, dependent: :destroy
  # Bucket tracks send history (posts already made) - destroy when bucket deleted

  # Bucket can be listed in marketplace (optional) - destroy when bucket deleted

  # VALIDATIONS
  # Bucket must have a name

  # SCOPES
  # Find marketplace buckets (account_id = 0 means it's for sale)
